Question 6)Java Programming Question: Advanced Canteen System
Question:
Problem Statement:
You are tasked with developing an Canteen System for a small canteen that handles ordering and billing. The system should present a menu with options for ordering tea, coffee, and samosas. The user can place orders, view their bill, and check out. The program should:
Display the canteen menu showing the price of each item (tea, coffee, samosas).


Allow the user to order items by selecting the item number (1 for Tea, 2 for Coffee, 3 for Samosa) and entering the quantity.

View the bill that shows:
The total cost of each item ordered.
The subtotal (sum of the cost of all ordered items).
A 5% tax on the subtotal.
The grand total, which includes the subtotal and tax.
Allow the user to checkout and exit the system.
The program should continuously display the menu of options until the user chooses to exit. The switch-case statement should be used to implement the logic for handling different user choices.

Requirements:
Use the switch-case statement for handling different options such as:
Viewing the menu.
Ordering items.
Viewing the bill.
Exiting the system.

Each item in the menu (Tea, Coffee, Samosa) should have a fixed price:
Tea: ₹10
Coffee: ₹15
Samosa: ₹20
The tax rate should be set to 5% of the subtotal.


Item quantity validation:
If the user enters an invalid quantity (less than or equal to 0), display an error message.
If the user selects an invalid item number, display an error message.
If the user selects an option not available in the menu (i.e., any number other than 1, 2, 3, or 4), show an error message.

Once the user selects "Checkout and Exit", print a thank you message and exit the system.
