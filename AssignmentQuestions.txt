Q1:
Write a Java program to input the radius of a circle and calculate its area using the formula:
Area = π × r²
Display the result as a floating-point number with two decimal places.


Q2)
 Write a Java program to calculate Simple Interest and Total Amount.
 Input values should include:
Principal (double)


Rate of Interest in % (double)


Time in years (double)
 Use the formula:
 Simple Interest = (P × R × T) / 100
 Display the interest and total amount.


Q3:
 Write a Java program to calculate Compound Interest and Total Amount.
 Input values should include:
Principal (double)
Rate of Interest in % (double)
Time in years (double)

 Use the formula:
 Amount = P × (1 + R/100)ᵀ
 Compound Interest = Amount − Principal
 Display the compound interest and total amount 

 Q4:
 Write a Java program to input and display student details.
 The program should ask the user to enter:
Name (String)
Roll Number (int)
Age (int)
Grade (String)

 Then, print all the student details in a clear format.


Q5)
Q:
 Write a Java program to calculate Simple Interest and Compound Interest where the time is entered in months.
Input:
Principal amount (double)
Annual rate of interest in percentage (double)
Time in months (int)
Requirements:
Convert time in months to years.
Calculate:

Simple Interest using the formula:
 SI = (Principal × Rate × Time) / 100

Compound Interest using the formula:
 CI = Principal × (1 + Rate/100)^Time − Principal

Print both interests and their corresponding total amounts.
Output:
Time in years (converted from months)
Simple Interest and Total with Simple Interest
Compound Interest and Total with Compound Interest
